        "**Situation:** \n",
        "You are a Cloud Engineer at \"GlobalConnect Inc.,\" a rapidly growing tech company whose core business relies heavily on a **mission-critical web application**. This application, currently hosted in a single GCP region (`us-central1`), serves millions of users daily. Recently, there was a minor outage in a related service, highlighting the urgent need for a robust **Disaster Recovery (DR) plan** to ensure continuous availability and minimize downtime in the event of a regional failure or significant incident.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Task:** \n",
        "Your task is to design a **multi-region disaster recovery strategy** for GlobalConnect Inc.'s critical web application. This plan should ensure that the application can **fail over** to a secondary region with minimal data loss and downtime, maintaining business continuity even during a catastrophic event in the primary region. You need to identify the key GCP services to achieve this and outline their roles within your DR strategy.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Action:** \n",
        "1.  **Choose a secondary GCP region** for your DR setup that is geographically distinct from `us-central1`. Consider network latency and regulatory requirements (though for this lab, a simple choice is fine).\n",
        "2.  **Identify core components** of a typical web application (e.g., front-end, back-end compute, database, storage, load balancing).\n",
        "3.  For each core component, **select appropriate GCP services** that support multi-region deployment and disaster recovery capabilities.\n",
        "4.  **Outline the mechanism for data replication** between the primary and secondary regions for your chosen database and storage services.\n",
        "5.  **Describe the failover process**: How will traffic be redirected to the secondary region during a disaster? What triggers this failover?\n",
        "6.  **Consider backup and restore strategies**: How will data be backed up, and how can it be restored if needed?\n",
        "7.  **Briefly explain how you would test this DR plan** (without actually performing the test).\n",
        "\n",
        "**Expected Result:** \n",
        "A **concise Disaster Recovery Plan summary** in Markdown format, outlining the chosen GCP services, the multi-region strategy, data replication methods, failover mechanisms, and backup considerations. The summary should clearly articulate how each component contributes to a resilient and highly available application, similar to the example provided in the \"Your Assignment\" section below."
